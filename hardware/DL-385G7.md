on gaining access:

use nmap to scan for link-local ipv6 address
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/51523/how-do-i-use-nmap-to-scan-a-range-of-ipv6-addresses

> nmap -6 --script=targets-ipv6-multicast-* --script-args=newtargets -PS --top-ports=10000

Once discovered setup a local loopback redirect to the SSL port (as port 80 automatically redicrets anyway)
 
> ssh -L '8443:[fe80::ea39:35ff:f321:5b8e%eth0]:443' ::1

Then use web browser https://localhost:8443

Firefox may have issues with the older SSL ciphers, use google chrome or brave or IE instead

As firefox is notworking, java applet based remote console also isnt functional.
